# loading_bar
simple css gradient loading bars

Challenges
Initially created one keyframe animation to apply to all bars with corresponding delays. However, that only worked for the first iteration and subsequent runs afterward did not display as expected.

Solution
Created multiple keyframe anmations for each bar that changes colour at different percentage points of the duration.
